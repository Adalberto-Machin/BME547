# Programming Assessment

This assessment is designed to help evaluate your initial understanding of basic
programming concepts.  While your responses will not be "graded", completion
of this assessment will be included as part of your participation grade.

Difficulty in completing some parts of this assessment will help indicate 
areas for additional study so that you are prepared for the
other assignments in this course.

Complete the following exercises in the programming language of your choice.
Then, e-mail me the source code file(s) you created.  If you choose to use 
Python, please rename the source code files to have the `*.txt` extension
rather than the `*.py` extension as the Duke e-mail system will view a Python
file as a potentially hazardous script.  In your e-mail, please indicate the
programming language you used.  If you cannot complete one of the parts of this
assignment, that is okay and simply indicates an area for some additional
learning so you can be successful in the rest of the course.

## One
* Create a single array or list that contains the following strings:
  + apple
  + banana
  + cranberry
  + date
  + eggplant
  + fennel
  + guava
* Store this array or list in a single variable.  You can read this data in
  from a file or manually enter (hard-code) it into your code.
* From this array or list, write code that will create two new arrays or lists.  
  One array should contain all the words from the first array with five 
  characters or less.  The second should contain all the words with six 
  characters or more.
* For each of these two new arrays or lists, do the following.  To the screen 
  or an output file, output each word on its own line.
  
## Two
* Write a function that will return true if a given number, sent as a 
  parameter, is positive.
* Write a function that accepts three parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and
  returns the two solutions to the quadratic formula.
* Write a program that 
  + somehow accepts three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`
    - these inputs can be either user input from the keyboard, input from a 
      file, or entered directly into the code as variables)
  + uses the two functions from above to determine whether
  the roots of the quadratic equation based on the three inputted parameters 
    are of the same sign and outputs that answer.
