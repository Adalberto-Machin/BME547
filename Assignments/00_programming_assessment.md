# Programming Assessment

This assessment is designed to understand your initial understanding of basic
programming concepts.  While your responses will not be "graded", completion
of this assessment will be included as part of your participation grade.

Difficulty in completing some parts of this assessment will help indicate what
areas some additional study should be done so that you are prepared for the
other assignments in this course.

Complete the following exercises in the programming language of your choice.

## One
* Load the attached input file, which contains a list of words, into an array
  or list and store it in a variable.  Import the data directly from the file
  in your code if you can.  Otherwise, manually enter (copy/paste) it in your 
  program.
* From this array or list, create two new arrays or lists.  One will contain
  all the words from the first array with five characters or less.  The 
  second will contain all the words with six characters or more.
* For each of these two new lists, do the following.  To the screen or an 
  output file, output each word on its own line.
  
## Two
* Write a function that accepts three parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and
  returns the two solutions to the quadratic formula.
* Write a function that will return true if a given number is positive.
* Write a program that somehow accepts three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `c` from
  either user input from the keyboard, input from a file, or entered as
  variables) and then uses the two functions from above to determine whether
  the roots of the quadratic equation based on the three parameters are of the
  same sign.
