## Ideas
* Calculate BMI from entered weight and height
* Have options for entry in Imperial or Metric units
* Have option for manual/console entry, or file entry?
* Or, just run from code?  in other words, have modular BMI calculator,
unit conversions, and such, and then call those procedures from a main
program.
* Use git branch for developing code for BMI in metric, then a new branch for
code to convert Imperial-Metric
