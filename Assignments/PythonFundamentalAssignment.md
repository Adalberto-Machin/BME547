# Python Fundamental Assignment


This assignment will be done using Jupyter notebooks.

First, create a virtual environment.  Activate this environment and install 
the `jupyter` package in this virtual environment.

You will receive a link to a GitHub Classroom.  Log into your GitHub account
and then visit that site.  This will create a repository specific for you.
Clone this repository onto your local computer.

Navigate to the folder in which you cloned the repository.  Then type:
```
jupyter notebook PythonFundamentals.ipynb
```
A web browser will automatically launch, or you will be instructed to open a
browser and open address `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.  This browser window
will contain the Jupyter Notebook for you to use.

Work through the interactive notebook.  Make sure to save it when you are
complete.  Then, in git, add and commit the completed Jupyter Notebook file
and then push the commit up to GitHub.  Visit the GitHub Classroom repository
to ensure that your completed notebook is in fact uploaded.  We will be 
grading the file that is found in your GitHub Classroom site.
