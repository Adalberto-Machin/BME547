# Working as a Team in GitHub

+ Introduce Teams

* Identify one team member as the first to join the assignment.  Upon visiting
the GitHub Classroom site, this team member will need to create a new team
using the given team name.  This action will create a new team repository.      
* Other team members can now visit the GitHub Classroom site, and join the
already existing team.

+ Create a project
+ Create big milestones.  Examples:  
  + Create webserver
  + Setup Database
  + Design GUI
+ Create issues and add to milestones
  + Can use as a roadmap for getting work done.
  + What is a task for getting webserver going?
  + Add assignee
  + Add to project
  + Add to milestone

* Avoid direct commits to master branch
  + Solving conflicts
    - [Description of how to solve conflicts](../Resources/Git/MergeConflicts.md)
    - [Example](https://github.com/dward2/class_conflict)
* Consider protection rules for master branch
* Review of pull requests
* Use .gitignore file to make sure you don't push up your venv or .idea files,
as if others download, can break their stuff.
  
+ All questions about project should be directed through issues
  + Make sure to add recipient as assignee or tag them.
  + Link to code with issue
  + For errors, link to a unit test or code that I can run to generate issue.
