# Working as a Team in GitHub

<!---
+ Introduce Teams

* Identify one team member as the first to join the assignment.  Upon visiting
the GitHub Classroom site, this team member will need to create a new team
using the given team name.  This action will create a new team repository.      
* Other team members can now visit the GitHub Classroom site, and join the
already existing team.
--->

* Use `.gitignore` file 
  + Prevents you from pushing up your venv or other settings files which bloats 
    repositories and can break the set-up of others who clone your repo.
  + You can create a template version of `.gitignore` in GitHub:
    - Click "Add File" and select "Create new file"
    - Enter `.gitignore` as file name.  A new dropdown box will display in
      upper right portion of window in which you can select "Python".
    - Commit the file and make sure to pull it to your local repository.
    - Add any uniquely named virtual environments, `.idea`, or other things
      not already in the template.
  + Note: a default license file can be added in the same way.  Just enter
    "license.txt" or "license.md" as the file name.
      
+ Create big milestones.  Examples:  
  + Create webserver
  + Setup Database
  + Design GUI
+ Create issues and add to milestones
  + Can use as a roadmap for getting work done.
  + What is a task for getting webserver going?
  + Add assignee
  + Add to milestone
  + Add to project (if using projects)

* Avoid direct commits to master branch
  + Solving conflicts
    - [Description of how to solve conflicts](../Resources/Git/MergeConflicts.md)
    - [Example](https://github.com/dward2/class_conflict)
* Review of pull requests
* Consider protection rules for master branch (requires Settings access)
  
+ All questions about project should be directed through issues
  + Make sure to add recipient as assignee or tag them.
  + Link to code with issue
  + For errors, link to a unit test or code that I can run to generate issue.
  + Or link to GitHub Actions report
  
## Final Project Planning
##### HRSS Lookback
* Each team member should complete the following template:

| | What went well | What could go better | What to do different
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | | | |
| Communication | | | |
| Execution | | | |
* Share this with me and your teammates
* As a team, develop milestones and issues.
* Assign a team member (and optional due date) to each issue.
* Use of a project is optional.
* Communicate to me when your plan is complete so I may review it.
* Target completion of plan by end of day Sunday, April 11.  
* I will be looking to see how you use Milestones/Issues for communication
in my grading of the final project.
