# BME 547 - Medical Software Design
### Spring 2020

## Remote Learning Update (posted 3/20/20)
**Here are the changes that will be made for the class to finish the semester
under the remote learning scheme.**
* Lecture content will be delievered by pre-recorded video that will be found
on Panopto.  The [schedule](schedule.md) will be updated for each lecture topic
to include not only a link to the appropriate GitHub lecture notes page but
also a link to the corresponding Panopto videos.  There may be more than one
video per lecture topic.
* Open office hours will be held during our normally scheduled lecture time of
Wed./Fri. 11:45 am to 1:00 pm.  This time can be used to ask questions about 
the pre-recorded lecture videos and/or give additional live demonstrations as
dictated by those in the office hours.  Other topics of interest may be 
addressed.  Participation in these office hours is optional.  
* These office hours will be held virtually using [Zoom](https://duke.zoom.us). 
The Zoom meetings can be joined through Sakai.  On the class Sakai
website, click on "Zoom Meetings" in the left hand menu, and then click "Join"
next to the appropriate time.
* Individual help and discussion will continue to be given via e-mail, GitHub
Issues, and 1-1 "virtual" conversation as requested.
* Assignments will continue to be given through Sakai and turned in via GitHub 
Classroom repositories.
