# Flask Info

In Conda, I set up a virtual environment and loaded flask.
Then, I wrote a simply python script (flask_basic.py) that had an
```
if __name__ == "__main__"
    app.run()
 ```
Then, in anaconda prompt, entered
```
set FLASK_APP=flask_basic
flask run
```

This ran my code.

Website I got this info from:
