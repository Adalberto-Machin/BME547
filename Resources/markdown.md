\*.md files indicate markdown formatting on render of content

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for 
a good intro/summary.

Detailed documentation can be found at 
<https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github>.

The full "GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec" can be found at 
<https://github.github.com/gfm/>.

Markdown viewer plug-ins can be found for many text/code editors for editing/
viewing markdown files locally.

For notepad++, one option is MarkdownViewer++
